=Considerations for licensees=

===Understand the license.===

======Read the legal code, not just the deed.====== 
The human-readable deed is a summary of, but not a replacement for, the [[legal code]]. It does not explain everything you need to know before using licensed material. 

======Make sure the license grants permission for what you want to do.====== 
There are six different CC licenses. Two of the licenses prohibit the sharing of [[/Frequently_Asked_Questions#What_is_an_adaptation.3F|adaptations]] (BY-ND, BY-NC-ND); three prohibit [[Frequently_Asked_Questions#Does_my_use_violate_the_NonCommercial_clause_of_the_licenses.3F|commercial uses]] (BY-NC, BY-NC-ND, BY-NC-SA), and two require adaptations be licensed [[Frequently_Asked_Questions#If_I_derive_or_adapt_material_offered_under_a_Creative_Commons_license.2C_which_CC_license.28s.29_can_I_use.3F|under the same license]] (BY-SA, BY-NC-SA). 

======Take note of the particular version of the license.====== 
The current version (4.0) [[License Versions|differs from prior versions in important respects]]. Similarly, the [[Frequently_Asked_Questions#What_are_the_international_.28.E2.80.9Cunported.E2.80.9D.29_Creative_Commons_licenses.2C_and_why_does_CC_offer_.E2.80.9Cported.E2.80.9D_licenses.3F|jurisdiction ports]] may differ in certain terms, such as dispute resolution and choice of law.   

===Scope of the license.===

======Pay attention to what exactly is being licensed.======
The licensor should have [[Marking_your_work_with_a_CC_license|marked]] which elements of the work are subject to the license and which are not. For those elements that are not subject to the license, [[/Frequently_Asked_Questions#Does_a_Creative_Commons_license_give_me_all_the_rights_I_need_to_use_the_work.3F|you may need separate permission]]. 

======Consider clearing rights if you are concerned.======  
The license does not contain a warranty, so if you think there may be third party rights in the material, you may want to clear those rights in advance. 

======Some uses of licensed material do not require permission under the license.====== 
If the use you want to make of a work falls within an [[Frequently_Asked_Questions#Do_I_always_have_to_comply_with_the_license_terms.3F_If_not.2C_what_are_the_exceptions.3F|exception or limitation]] to copyright or similar rights, you may do so.  Those uses are unregulated by the license.

===Know your obligations.===

======Provide attribution.====== 
All CC licenses require you provide [[Frequently_Asked_Questions#How_do_I_properly_attribute_material_offered_under_a_Creative_Commons_license.3F|attribution]] and [[Marking/Users|mark the material]] when you share it publicly. The specific requirements [[License_Versions#Attribution-specific_elements|vary slightly across versions]].

======Do not restrict others from exercising rights under the license.====== 
All CC licenses prohibit you from [[Frequently_Asked_Questions#Can_I_use_effective_technological_measures_.28such_as_DRM.29_when_I_share_CC-licensed_material.3F|applying effective technological measures]] or imposing legal terms that would prevent others from doing what the license permits. 

======Determine what, if anything, you can do with adaptations you make.====== 
Depending on what type of license is applied, you are limited in [[Frequently_Asked_Questions#Can_I_combine_material_that_uses_different_Creative_Commons_licenses_into_my_work.3F|whether you can share your adaptation]] and if so, [[Frequently_Asked_Questions#If_I_derive_or_adapt_material_offered_under_a_Creative_Commons_license.2C_which_CC_license.28s.29_can_I_use.3F|what license you can apply to your contributions]].

======Termination is automatic.======  
All CC licenses [[Frequently_Asked_Questions#How_can_I_lose_my_rights_under_a_Creative_Commons_license.3F_If_that_happens.2C_how_do_I_get_them_back.3F|terminate automatically]] when you fail to comply with its terms.  If the material is under a 4.0 license, you must fix the problem within 30 days of discovery if you want your rights automatically reinstated. 

===Consider licensor preferences.===

======Consider complying with non-binding requests by the licensor.====== 
The licensor may make special requests when you use the material. We recommend you do so when reasonable, but that is your option and not your obligation.
